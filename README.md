# LinearKnob

I personally find it distracting to control a knob by radial mouse movement. 
The LinearKnob is basically a subclassed NSSliderCell which:
- allows for linear vertical movement
- extends the range for a finer grained control 
- doesn't jump to the point where you click first (translates only relative changes of the mouse)
